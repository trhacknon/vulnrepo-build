Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong encryption (not supporting weaker, insecure protocols or methods).Verifying that certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted source)helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. Generally, the web  page URL  should begin with “HTTPS“  and/or the web  browser display a padlock icon somewhere in the window of the browser. Many TLS certificate vendors also provide a highly visible verification seal—sometimes referred to as a “security seal,” “secure site seal“, or “secure trust seal”)—whichmay provide the ability to click on the seal to reveal information about the website.Refer  to industry standards and best practices for information on strong cryptography and secure protocols (e.g.,NIST SP  800-52  and SP  800-57, OWASP,  etc.)Note:SSL/early  TLS  is not  considered  strong cryptography and  may not  be  used as a  security control,  except by POS  POI  terminals  that  are verified  as not  being  susceptible  to  known exploits and  the  termination  points  to which  they connect as defined  in  AppendixA2."

Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV  light marker,to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacementwill be apparent.

Any such unauthorized device could result in an unauthorized access point into the environment.Knowing which wireless devices are authorized can help administrators quickly identify non-authorized wireless devices, and responding to the identification of unauthorized wireless access points helps to proactively minimize the exposure of CDE to malicious individuals.Due  to the ease  with which a wireless access point can be  attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting their presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices, these processes must be  performed even when a policy exists prohibiting the use of wireless technology.The size and complexity of a particular environment will dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been installed in the environment.  For example:In  the case of  a single  standalone retail  kiosk in  a  shopping  mall,  where  all communication  components  are  contained  within tamper-resistant  and  tamper-evident  casings, performing  a detailed  physical  inspection  of  the kiosk itself  may be  sufficient  to provide  assurance that  a rogue  wireless  access point  has not  been attached  or installed.  However,  in an  environment with  multiple  nodes  (such as in  a  large  retail  store, call  center,  server room  or data  center), detailed physical  inspection  is difficult.  In  this case, multiple methods  may  be combined  to  meet  the requirement,  such as performing  physical  system inspections  in  conjunction  with  the  results of  a wireless  analyzer."

Conductinga vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a  penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester  uses their knowledge of systems to penetrateinto an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester  finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a  tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment.Penetrationtesting techniques will  be  different  for different  organizations,  and the type, depth,  and complexity of  the  testing will  depend  on  the specific environment and the organization’s risk assessment."
